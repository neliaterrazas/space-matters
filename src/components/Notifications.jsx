        <p className="center">Space Matters was a project of PCC Facilities Planning as a means to align built environments with PCC’s strategic vision for equity and inclusion. Through training and practical experience, Space Matters invited students to explore CRT and spatial theories as a means to design campus‐based inquiry projects that seek to explore relationships between race and space at PCC. Students participate in 3 daylong workshops, conduct activities in between workshop sessions to further campus‐based inquiry projects (ex: taking photos, talking to peers, conducting research), and present project insights and reflections to the PCC community.</p>
        <p className="center">Space Matters is also part of a dissertation study. The aim of the study is to increase knowledge that may help educational leaders and campus planners to align facilities planning and design with institutional values for equity and inclusion.
