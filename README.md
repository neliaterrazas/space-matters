## Description/Component Structure

![](src/assets/imgs/updatedChart.png)

This is the _updated_ structure I used to continue to develop my site. This chart displays component structure for the main homepage and other functionality not immeadiately seen on front page.

## Roadmap

This site is still under construction. I have implemented a model if one would like to update a beer list and have it display on the home page. Now that I have correctly implemented a stateful component, my next focus is on styling. I am painfully close to being able to delete a beer from the taplist.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository at https://github.com/neliaterrazas/react-template.git onto your desktop
* Run npm i to install dependencies
* $ npm run start so display on your local browser
* Go to localhost:8080/#/beercontrol to add a new beer.


## Known Bugs

Beer updates to list until you refresh (then it resets).
